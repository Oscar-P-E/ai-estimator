# AI-Powered Quoting Assistant

This project is a Next.js web application that allows customers to verbally interact with an AI to receive quotes based on the contents of their own pricing documents (such as Excel files). The AI can handle documents with varying structures and ask clarifying questions to generate accurate quotes.

## Features
- **Conversational AI Interface**: Customers can chat or speak with the AI to request quotes.
- **Flexible Document Processing**: Upload Excel files with any structure; the system extracts pricing data.
- **Quote Generation**: The AI uses the extracted data to generate quotes, asking clarifying questions as needed.
- **Voice Input**: Users can interact with the AI using speech recognition.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js** (React, API routes)
- **TypeScript**
- **xlsx** (for Excel file parsing)
- **react-speech-recognition** (for voice input)
